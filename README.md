# Get oceanographic information for ecological applications
 
Codes to get oceanographic information from [ERDDAP](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html), [HYCOM](https://www.hycom.org/), or [COPERNICUS](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/products). You can also get bathymetric data using the [marmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marmap/index.html) R package. 

These codes efficiently download the oceanographic data and then find the right value for each observation in your data based on spatial location and time. Minimum handling is required. Below, I provide specific instructions for each oceanographic data source.
